#' Some protein traces of e4 that were filtered. TESTING DATA.
'protein.traces'

#' A sample data.table that holds information on CORUM complex membership.
#'
#' Each row in this data.table corresponds to an association between a CORUM
#' complex and a protein subunit.
#' The structure of this data.table is as follows:
#' \itemize{
#'  \item \code{complex_id} The numeric id of a CORUM complex. 
#'  \item \code{complex_name} A character string of the complex' name.
#'  \item \code{protein_id} The Uniprot identifier of the protein.
#' }
